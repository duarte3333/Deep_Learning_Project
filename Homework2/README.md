# Homework 2 - Skeleton Code

This archive contains everything you need to complete Homework 2. It contains the following files:

## download_octmnist.py

Allows you to download the OCTMNIST dataset to a compressed `.npz` file, which `hw2-q2.py` can load.

## utils.py

Utility functions for `hw2-q2.py`

## hw2-q2.py

Contains skeleton code for Question 2, which covers image classification using CNNs, with implementation in torch.

## hw2-q3.ipynb

Contains skeleton code for Question 3, which covers a sequence-to-sequence task using RNNs and attention, with implementation in torch. We suggest using *google colab* or *kaggle* to run the notebook with GPU accelerators.

## how-to-use-kaggle-tutorial.md

A simple tutorial on how to run the notebook `hw2-q3.ipynb` in kaggle.
